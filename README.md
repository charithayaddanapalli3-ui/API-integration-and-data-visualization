## 📌 Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization

**Description:**  
In this task, I developed a Python script that integrates with a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time data. The script processes the retrieved information and generates meaningful visualizations using libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

The goal of this task is to demonstrate the ability to:
- Connect to and consume data from external APIs.  
- Parse and structure the data for analysis.  
- Create clear and insightful visualizations to represent trends or patterns.  

**Deliverables:**  
- A Python script (`task1.py`) that fetches and processes API data.  
- Visualization outputs (graphs/charts) showcasing the data.  
- A simple dashboard or plots that highlight key insights.  

**Tools & Libraries Used:**  
- `requests` → For API calls  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` → For data visualization  
- `json` → For handling API responses
